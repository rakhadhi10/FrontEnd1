		"Most people will jo tables without even realizing it every day, using the SELECT statement. The advantage to the SELECT statement is that it’s very simple; as noted, most people don’t even realize that they’ve used it. But the disadvantage to the SELECT statement is that it doesn’t afford you a lot of control regarding how the table is being joined. And, of course, it can feel messy as well. Because every column has to be called with its table name and its own name, it can be difficult to read.Let’s say you want to control the table’s order when you select data from multiple tables, connect to the left table specifically, or use foreign keys. Other types of joins and SQL queries might be more applicable, and you may need advanced join operations.Other JOIN SQL queries will give you more control over data manipulation. This can help you not only get the results that you need but also control the resources that you use when completing the query. Joining multiple tables is often resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU and memory. Because of this, you want to make sure that you are streamlining and optimizing your queries as much as possible.",
